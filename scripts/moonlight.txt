Lotta black folks in Cuba, but you

This one time...

This old lady, she stopped me.
She said...
"Running around...
catching up all that light.
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.
You blue.
That's what I gon' call you.
Blue."
So your name Blue?
Nah.
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gonna be.
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.

Thank you.
What's a faggot?
A faggot is...
a word used
to make gay people feel bad.
- Am I a faggot?

No.
You can be gay, but you gotta

I mean, unless...
How do I know?
You just do.

can be dangerous
to the human body, right?
Okay, can anybody explain
what will happen to the body
if there's not enough
white blood cells?
Ain't nobody's leaving this

You know the deal.
Your ass eat, your ass speak.
All right, straight up?
Yeah, nigga, straight up.
I'm trappin'.
What?
Yeah.
When they sent me to Atlanta, put me
straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.
Met this dude in there.
When I come out,
he put me on the block.
Did good at it and rose up.
It is what it is.
Bullshit, man.
That ain't what it is.
That ain't you, Chiron.
Nigga, you don't know me.
I don't know you?
There you are.

Why you got

Ride dirty, huh?
Something like that.
So how you be in to work?

Sometimes Samantha shoot me out

I can't picture bein' in Miami
with no car.
- Man, it's real out here.

Shot me like a duck

This nigga said "a duck."

Nah, I'm just tired, bruh.
Hey man, bet on the ride,

- Well then what?
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't tryin'
to hem you up, man, it's just...
I ain't seen you
in a minute and...
it's not what I expected.
Well what did you expect?
You remember...
You remember the last time
I saw you?
For a long time,
tried not to remember.
Tried to forget all those times.
Yeah.
When we got to Atlanta...
I started over.
Built myself from the ground up.
Built myself hard.
- What about you? You...
- Me?
I wasn't never really
worth shit.
Just kept on, man.
Never really did anything
I actually wanted to do.
It was all I could do was to do what folks
thought I should be doing.
I wasn't never really myself.
And now?
Now?
Now, man... now I got li'l Kev.
Got this job.
Another 18 months of probation.
That's some real shit, man.
Nah, man.
It's a life.
You know?
I ain't never had that before.
Like...
Like, I'm tired as hell
right now, man,
and I ain't making more
than shoe money, but...
I ain't got no worries, man.
Not them kind what I had before.
That's that real shit.
That's that Bob Marley shit,
nigga.
You the only man
that's ever touched me.
You're the only one.
I haven't really
touched anyone, since.
